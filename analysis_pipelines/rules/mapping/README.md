# Rules for mapping reads

All files in this folder contain rules for mapping reads from a fastq file onto fasta references to produce alignments in bam files (or in the future cram files). If you add a file here, you should also add the corresponding include statement to the aggregating rule file named after this folder in the parent folder.
