# Manuscript after addressing reviews

This folder contains the LaTeX files for the Prosolo benchmarking paper "ProSolo: Accurate and Scalable Variant Calling from Single Cell DNA Sequencing Data" after two rounds of revisions that address reviewer comments.
This includes the main manuscript (`main.tex`) and the supplement (`supplement.tex`) and all the files necessary for compiling them into PDFs---especially including all the figures used in the manuscript.
For those figures, this folder further includes all the `R` scripts used to generate them and the plain text result data files (usually tab-separated) they need as input.
For overview figures, this includes the vector graphic version in both `pdf` and `svg` formats, where the `svg` files should be editable using a current version of the free and open source software [`Inkscape`](https://inkscape.org/).
