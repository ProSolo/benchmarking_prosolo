"""
This file aggregates all rules for preprocessing fastq files before
mapping (e.g. trimming, quality control), which are specified in the
folder "preprocessing". If you add a file to that folder, you should
also add the corresponding include statement here.

Configuration of the processes to run in this stage should be provided
in YAML format and specified in the Snakefile. For a commented example,
see config.yaml in the directory pipelines, in particular:

stages:
    preprocessing: ''
