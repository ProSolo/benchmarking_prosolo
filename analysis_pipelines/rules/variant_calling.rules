This file aggregates all rules for variant calling on a bam (or in the
future cram) file, which are specified in the folder "variant_calling".
If you add a file to that folder, you should also add the corresponding
include statement here.

Configuration of the processes to run in this stage should be provided
in YAML format and specified in the Snakefile. For a commented example,
see config.yaml in the directory pipelines, in particular:

stages:
