This file aggregates all rules for processing of bam files that are
specified in the folder "bam_processing". If you add a file to that
folder, you should also add the corresponding include statement here.

Configuration of the processes to run in this stage should be provided
in YAML format and specified in the Snakefile. For a commented example,
see config.yaml in the directory pipelines, in particular:
