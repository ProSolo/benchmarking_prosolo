	abstract = {Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a recently described method of whole-genome amplification (WGA) that has proven efficient in the amplification of small amounts of DNA, including DNA from single cells. Compared with PCR-based WGA methods, MDA generates DNA with a higher molecular weight and shows better genome coverage. This protocol was developed for preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and details a method for performing single-cell MDA using the $\varphi$30 DNA polymerase. It can also be useful for the amplification of other minute quantities of DNA, such as from forensic material or microdissected tissue. The protocol includes the collection and lysis of single cells, and all materials and steps involved in the MDA reaction. The whole procedure takes 3 h and generates 1{\textendash}2 $\mu$g of DNA from a single cell, which is suitable for multiple downstream applications, such as sequencing, short tandem repeat analysis or array comparative genomic hybridization.Note: In the version of this article initially published online, the third and fourth panels of Figure 1 (p. 1965) were incorrectly drawn. Figure 1 has been corrected in all versions of the article.},

decision theoretic perspective to critically compare competing approaches. We set up decision problems that lead to the use of FDR-based rules and generalizations. Alternative definitions of the probability model and the utility function lead to different rules and problem-specific adjustments. Using a loss function that controls realized FDR we derive an optimal Bayes rule that is a variation of the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) procedure. The cutoff is based on increments in ordered posterior probabilities instead of ordered p-values. Throughout the discussion we take a Bayesian perspective. In particular, we focus on conditional expected FDR, conditional on the data. Variations of the probability model include explicit modeling for dependence. Variations of the utility function include weighting by the extent of a true negative and
accounting for the impact in the final decision.},

	abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

	abstract = {Precision medicine is emerging as a cornerstone of future cancer care with the objective of providing targeted therapies based on the molecular phenotype of each individual patient. Traditional bulk-level molecular phenotyping of tumours leads to significant information loss, as the molecular profile represents an average phenotype over large numbers of cells, while cancer is a disease with inherent intra-tumour heterogeneity at the cellular level caused by several factors, including clonal evolution, tissue hierarchies, rare cells and dynamic cell states. Single-cell sequencing provides means to characterize heterogeneity in a large population of cells and opens up opportunity to determine key molecular properties that influence clinical outcomes, including prognosis and probability of treatment response. Single-cell sequencing methods are now reliable enough to be used in many research laboratories, and we are starting to see applications of these technologies for characterization of human primary cancer cells. In this review, we provide an overview of studies that have applied single-cell sequencing to characterize human cancers at the single-cell level, and we discuss some of the current challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {Individualized neuronal mutations in the human brain
The neurons of the human brain can last for decades, carrying out computational and signaling functions. Lodato et al. analyzed the DNA of individual neurons sampled from postmortem human brains and found that individual neurons acquired somatic mutations (see the Perspective by Linnarsson). The mechanism of mutation involved gene transcription rather than DNA replication. Thus, postmitotic neurons would seem to be their own worst enemy: Genes used for neuronal function are the very genes put most at risk of somatic mutation.
Science, this issue p. 94; see also p. 37
Neurons live for decades in a postmitotic state, their genomes susceptible to DNA damage. Here we survey the landscape of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human brain. We identified thousands of somatic SNVs by single-cell sequencing of 36 neurons from the cerebral cortex of three normal individuals. Unlike germline and cancer SNVs, which are often caused by errors in DNA replication, neuronal mutations appear to reflect damage during active transcription. Somatic mutations create nested lineage trees, allowing them to be dated relative to developmental landmarks and revealing a polyclonal architecture of the human cerebral cortex. Thus, somatic mutations in the brain represent a durable and ongoing record of neuronal life history, from development through postmitotic function.
Human brains are built from intermingled clones of cells that carry mutations linked to their use of particular neuronal genes. [Also see Perspective by Linnarsson]

Whole genome amplification (WGA) is a key step in single-cell sequencing workflows and a multitude of methods have been introduced. Here, we compare three state-of-the-art methods on both bulk and single-cell samples of E. coli DNA: Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA), Multiple Annealing and Looping Based Amplification Cycles (MALBAC), and the PicoPLEX single-cell WGA kit (NEB-WGA). We considered the effects of reaction gain on coverage uniformity, error rates and the level of background contamination. We compared the suitability of the different WGA methods for the detection of copy-number variations, for the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and for de-novo genome assembly. No single method performed best across all criteria and significant differences in characteristics were observed; the choice of which amplifier to use will depend strongly on the details of the type of question being asked in any given experiment.},

For studies of rare variation, family designs are especially attractive because they allow even very rare variants to be observed in multiple individuals and because they can be used to study the impact of de novo mutation events. An important challenge is that most raw sequencing data include many errors. Here, we develop a new approach for interpreting sequence data. We show that by analyzing sequence data across many family members together it is possible to greatly reduce error rates (measured either as the number of true variants that are missed or the number of false variants that are claimed). In addition to facilitating detection and genotyping of SNPs, our methods can interface with existing tools to improve the accuracy of more challenging short insertion deletion polymorphisms and other types of variants. Our methods should make studies of families even more attractive because, in addition to making it easy to study rare variants and de novo mutation events, family studies will now be able to better transform sequence data into accurate genotypes.},

To develop a robust statistical method capable of identifying variants that would otherwise not be called, we conducted sequence data simulations and both whole-genome and targeted sequencing data analysis of 28 families. Our method (Family-Based Sequencing Program, FamSeq) integrates Mendelian transmission information and raw sequencing reads. Sequence analysis using FamSeq reduced the number of false negative variants by 14{\textendash}33\% as assessed by HapMap sample genotype confirmation. In a large family affected with Wilms tumor, 84\% of variants uniquely identified by FamSeq were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In children with early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders from 26 families, de novo variant calls in disease candidate genes were corrected by FamSeq as Mendelian variants, and the number of uniquely identified variants in affected individuals increased proportionally as additional family members were included in the analysis. To gain insight into maximizing variant detection, we studied factors impacting actual improvements of family-based calling, including pedigree structure, allele frequency (common vs. rare variants), prior settings of minor allele frequency, sequence signal-to-noise ratio, and coverage depth (\~{}20{\texttimes} to {\textgreater}200{\texttimes}). These data will help guide the design, analysis, and interpretation of family-based sequencing studies to improve the ability to identify new disease-associated genes.},

	abstract = {Various algorithms have been developed for variant calling using next-generation sequencing data, and various methods have been applied to reduce the associated false positive and false negative rates. Few variant calling programs, however, utilize the pedigree information when the family-based sequencing data are available. Here, we present a program, FamSeq, which reduces both false positive and false negative rates by incorporating the pedigree information from the Mendelian genetic model into variant calling. To accommodate variations in data complexity, FamSeq consists of four distinct implementations of the Mendelian genetic model: the Bayesian network algorithm, a graphics processing unit version of the Bayesian network algorithm, the Elston-Stewart algorithm and the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. To make the software efficient and applicable to large families, we parallelized the Bayesian network algorithm that copes with pedigrees with inbreeding loops without losing calculation precision on an NVIDIA graphics processing unit. In order to compare the difference in the four methods, we applied FamSeq to pedigree sequencing data with family sizes that varied from 7 to 12. When there is no inbreeding loop in the pedigree, the Elston-Stewart algorithm gives analytical results in a short time. If there are inbreeding loops in the pedigree, we recommend the Bayesian network method, which provides exact answers. To improve the computing speed of the Bayesian network method, we parallelized the computation on a graphics processing unit. This allowed the Bayesian network method to process the whole genome sequencing data of a family of 12 individuals within two days, which was a 10-fold time reduction compared to the time required for this computation on a central processing unit.},

We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumour nuclei from an oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements occurred early in tumour evolution and remained highly stable as the tumour masses clonally expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity. Using targeted single-molecule sequencing, many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies ({\textless}10\%) in the tumour mass. Using mathematical modelling we found that the triple-negative tumour cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3{\texttimes}), whereas the ER+ tumour cells did not. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis, therapeutic treatment and evolution of chemoresistance in breast cancer.},

MDA amplified DNA from 49 single human blastomeres with 100\% success. The MDA products were genotyped using a total of 57 polymorphic markers for chromosomes 1, 7, 13, 18, 21, X and Y; 72\% of alleles amplified providing results at 90\% of the loci tested. A PGH cycle was carried out for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One embryo was biopsied: PGH showed a non-carrier female, which was transferred with no resulting pregnancy. A PGH cycle was carried out for cystic fibrosis. Seven embryos were biopsied and PGH allowed the exclusion of 2 affected embryos; a carrier and a non-carrier embryo were transferred resulting in an on-going twin pregnancy. PGH represents a paradigm shift in embryo diagnosis, as one panel of markers can be used for all carriers of the same monogenic disease, bypassing the need for development of mutation-specific tests, and widening the scope and availability of preimplantation genetic testing.},

	abstract = {Accumulation and selection of somatic mutations in a Darwinian framework result in intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) that poses significant challenges to the diagnosis and clinical therapy of cancer. Identification of the tumor cell populations (clones) and reconstruction of their evolutionary relationship can elucidate this heterogeneity. Recently developed single-cell DNA sequencing (SCS) technologies promise to resolve ITH to a single-cell level. However, technical errors in SCS datasets, including false-positives (FP), false-negatives (FN) due to allelic dropout and cell doublets, significantly complicate these tasks. Here, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian method that reconstructs the clonal populations as clusters of single cells, genotypes of each clone and the evolutionary relationships between the clones. It employs a tree-structured Chinese restaurant process as the prior on the number and composition of clonal populations. The evolution of the clonal populations is modeled by a clonal phylogeny and a finite-site model of evolution to account for potential mutation recurrence and losses. We probabilistically account for FP and FN errors, and cell doublets are modeled by employing a Beta-binomial distribution. We develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm comprising of partial reversible-jump and partial Metropolis-Hastings updates to explore the joint posterior space of all parameters. The performance of our method on synthetic and experimental datasets suggests that joint reconstruction of tumor clones and clonal phylogeny under a finite-site model of evolution leads to more accurate inferences. Our method is the first to enable this joint reconstruction in a fully Bayesian framework, thus providing measures of support of the inferences it makes.},

Single nucleus sequencing (SNS), combines flow sorting of single nuclei based on DNA content, whole genome amplification (WGA), followed by next generation sequencing to quantize genomic intervals in a genome wide manner. Multiplexing of single cells is discussed. Additionally, we outline informatic approaches that correct for biases inherent in the WGA procedure and allow for accurate determination of copy number profiles.

Central to current approaches is the infinite sites assumption that every genomic position can only mutate once over the lifetime of a tumor. The validity of this assumption has never been quantitatively assessed. We developed a rigorous statistical framework to test the infinite sites assumption with single-cell sequencing data. Our framework accounts for the high noise and contamination present in such data. We found strong evidence for the same genomic position being mutationally affected multiple times in individual tumors for 11 of 12 single-cell sequencing data sets from a variety of human cancers. Seven cases involved the loss of earlier mutations, five of which occurred at sites unaffected by large-scale genomic deletions. Four cases exhibited a parallel mutation, potentially indicating convergent evolution at the base pair level. Our results refute the general validity of the infinite sites assumption and indicate that more complex models are needed to adequately quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity for more effective cancer treatment.},

A thorough understanding of a tumour's subclonal composition and its mutational history is essential to open up the design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Comparative studies on a large number of tumours permit the identification of mutational patterns which may refine forecasts of cancer progression, response to treatment and metastatic potential. The composition of tumours is shaped by evolutionary processes. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing offer the possibility to analyse the evolutionary history and accompanying heterogeneity of tumours at an unprecedented resolution, by sequencing single cells. New computational challenges arise when moving from bulk to single-cell sequencing data, leading to the development of novel modelling frameworks. In this review, we present the state of the art methods for understanding the phylogeny encoded in bulk or single-cell sequencing data, and highlight future directions for developing more comprehensive and informative pictures of tumour evolution.

	abstract = {Reconstruction of cell lineage trees, from single-cell DNA sequencing data, has the potential to become a fundamental tool in studies of development and disease, in particular cancer. For cells without copy number alterations that has not been exposed to specific marking techniques, that is normal cells, lineage tracing is naturally based on somatic point mutations. Current single cell sequencing techniques applicable to such cells require an amplification step, which introduces errors, and still often suffer from so-called allelic dropout. We present a detailed model of current technologies, which is likely to capture also any near future technical improvements, for the purpose of estimating the distance between cells without copy number changes, based on single-cell DNA sequencing data. The model is equipped with prior probabilities for key parameters and allows for a Bayesian inference of the distance between two cells, simultaneously taking all the other cells into account. In particular, the model contains variables associated with pairs of loci, of which one is homozygous and the other heterozygous, and has the capacity to perform Bayesian probabilistic read phasing. By applying a fast distance based method, such as FNJ, to the estimated distance, a cell lineage tree can be obtained. In contrast to MCMC based methods, FNJ can easily handle data sets with tens of thousands of taxa. The high accuracy of the so obtained method, called SCuPhr (Single Cell Urn PHased Read), is shown in studies of several synthetic data set.},

Somatic variation has diverse physiological roles and pathological consequences, particularly when acquired variants influence the clonal trajectories of the affected cells.

Here, recently established databases on de novo mutations for monogenic disorders are used to estimate the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations and to derive a number of inferences with respect to eukaryotic genome evolution. Although the human per-generation mutation rate is exceptionally high, on a per-cell division basis, the human germline mutation rate is lower than that recorded for any other species. Comparison with data from other species demonstrates a universal mutational bias toward A/T composition, and leads to the hypothesis that genome-wide nucleotide composition generally evolves to the point at which the power of selection in favor of G/C is approximately balanced by the power of random genetic drift, such that variation in equilibrium genome-wide nucleotide composition is largely defined by variation in mutation biases. Quantification of the hazards associated with introns reveals that mutations at key splice-site residues are a major source of human mortality. Finally, a consideration of the long-term consequences of current human behavior for deleterious-mutation accumulation leads to the conclusion that a substantial reduction in human fitness can be expected over the next few centuries in industrialized societies unless novel means of genetic intervention are developed.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of evolution requires information on the rate of appearance of new mutations and their effects at the molecular and phenotypic levels. Although procuring such data has been technically challenging, high-throughput genome sequencing is rapidly expanding knowledge in this area. With information on spontaneous mutations now available in a variety of organisms, general patterns have emerged for the scaling of mutation rate with genome size and for the likely mechanisms that drive this pattern. Support is presented for the hypothesis that natural selection pushes mutation rates down to a lower limit set by the power of random genetic drift rather than by intrinsic physiological limitations, and that this has resulted in reduced levels of replication, transcription, and translation fidelity in eukaryotes relative to prokaryotes.},

	abstract = {Although it has been hypothesized that some of the somatic mutations found in tumors may occur before tumor initiation, there is little experimental or conceptual data on this topic. To gain insights into this fundamental issue, we formulated a mathematical model for the evolution of somatic mutations in which all relevant phases of a tissue{\textquoteright}s history are considered. The model makes the prediction, validated by our empirical findings, that the number of somatic mutations in tumors of self-renewing tissues is positively correlated with the age of the patient at diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis indicates that half or more of the somatic mutations in certain tumors of self-renewing tissues occur before the onset of neoplasia. The model also provides a unique way to estimate the in vivo tissue-specific somatic mutation rates in normal tissues directly from the sequencing data of tumors. Our results have substantial implications for the interpretation of the large number of genome-wide cancer studies now being undertaken.},

	abstract = {The identification of somatic driver mutations in cancer has enabled therapeutic advances by identifying drug targets critical to disease causation. However, such genomic discoveries in oncology have not translated into advances for non-cancerous disease since point mutations in a single cell would be unlikely to cause non-malignant disease. An exception to this would occur if the mutation happened early enough in development to be present in a large percentage of a tissue's cellular population. We sought to identify the existence of somatic mutations occurring early in human development by ascertaining base-pair mutations present in one of a pair of monozygotic twins, but absent from the other and assessing evidence for mosaicism. To do so, we genome-wide genotyped 66 apparently healthy monozygotic adult twins at 506 786 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in white blood cells. Discrepant SNPs were verified by Sanger sequencing and a selected subset was tested for mosaicism by targeted high-depth next-generation sequencing (20 000-fold coverage) as a surrogate marker of timing of the mutation. Two de novo somatic mutations were unequivocally confirmed to be present in white blood cells, resulting in a frequency of 1.2{\texttimes}10-7 mutations per nucleotide. There was little evidence of mosaicism on high-depth next-generation sequencing, suggesting that these mutations occurred early in embryonic development. These findings provide direct evidence that early somatic point mutations do occur and can lead to differences in genomes between otherwise identical twins, suggesting a considerable burden of somatic mutations among the trillions of mitoses that occur over the human lifespan.},

Due to the small amount of DNA within a single cell, whole-genome amplification becomes a mandatory step in many single-cell applications. Unfortunately, single-cell whole-genome amplification (scWGA) strategies suffer from several technical biases that complicate the posterior interpretation of the data. Here we compared the performance of six different scWGA methods (GenomiPhi, REPLIg, TruePrime, Ampli1, MALBAC, and PicoPLEX) after amplifying and low-pass sequencing the complete genome of 230 healthy/tumoral human cells. Overall, REPLIg outperformed competing methods regarding DNA yield, amplicon size, amplification breadth, amplification uniformity {\textendash}being the only method with a random amplification bias{\textendash}, and false single-nucleotide variant calls. On the other hand, non-MDA methods, and in particular Ampli1, showed less allelic imbalance and ADO, more reliable copy-number profiles and less chimeric amplicons. While no single scWGA method showed optimal performance for every aspect, they clearly have distinct advantages. Our results provide a convenient guide for selecting a scWGA method depending on the question of interest while revealing relevant weaknesses that should be considered during the analysis and interpretation of single-cell sequencing data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Meiotic recombination and de novo mutation are the two main contributions toward gamete genome diversity, and many questions remain about how an individual human{\textquoteright}s genome is edited by these two processes. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for single-cell whole-genome analysis that was used to measure the genomic diversity in one individual{\textquoteright}s gamete genomes. A microfluidic system was used for highly parallel sample processing and to minimize nonspecific amplification. High-density genotyping results from 91 single cells were used to create a personal recombination map, which was consistent with population-wide data at low resolution but revealed significant differences from pedigree data at higher resolution. We used the data to test for meiotic drive and found evidence for gene conversion. High-throughput sequencing on 31 single cells was used to measure the frequency of large-scale genome instability, and deeper sequencing of eight single cells revealed de novo mutation rates with distinct characteristics.},

Conbase leverages phased read data from multiple samples in a dataset to achieve increased confidence in somatic variant calls and genotype predictions. Comparing the performance of Conbase to three other methods, we find that Conbase performs best in terms of false discovery rate and specificity and provides superior robustness on simulated data, in vitro expanded fibroblasts and clonal lymphocyte populations isolated directly from a healthy human donor.},

	abstract = {Abstract The scarcity of genomic DNA can be a limiting factor in some fields of genetic research. One of the methods developed to overcome this difficulty is whole genome amplification (WGA). Recently, multiple displacement amplification (MDA) has proved very efficient in the WGA of small DNA samples and pools of cells, the reaction being catalyzed by the ?29 or the Bst DNA polymerases. The aim of the present study was to develop a reliable, efficient, and fast protocol for MDA at the single-cell level. We first compared the efficiency of ?29 and Bst polymerases on DNA samples and single cells. The ?29 polymerase generated accurately, in a short time and from a single cell, sufficient DNA for a large set of tests, whereas the Bst enzyme showed a low efficiency and a high error rate. A single-cell protocol was optimized using the ?29 polymerase and was evaluated on 60 single cells; the DNA obtained DNA was assessed by 22 locus-specific PCRs. This new protocol can be useful for many applications involving minute quantities of starting material, such as forensic DNA analysis, prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or cancer research.

	abstract = {Single cell genome analysis methods are powerful tools to define features of single cells and to identify differences between them. Since the DNA amount of a single cell is very limited, cellular DNA usually needs to be amplified by whole-genome amplification before being subjected to further analysis. A single nucleus only contains two haploid genomes. Thus, any DNA damage that prevents amplification results in loss of damaged DNA sites and induces an amplification bias. Therefore, the assessment of single cell DNA quality is urgently required. As of today, there is no simple method to determine the quality of a single cell DNA in a manner that will still retain the entire cellular DNA for amplification and downstream analysis. Here, we describe a method for whole-genome amplification with simultaneous quality control of single cell DNA by using a competitive spike-in DNA template.},

Here we introduce a novel multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method based on the unique DNA primase features of Thermus thermophilus (Tth) PrimPol. TthPrimPol displays a potent primase activity preferring dNTPs as substrates unlike conventional primases. A combination of TthPrimPol{\textquoteright}s unique ability to synthesize DNA primers with the highly processive Phi29 DNA polymerase ($\Phi$29DNApol) enables near-complete whole genome amplification from single cells. This novel method demonstrates superior breadth and evenness of genome coverage, high reproducibility, excellent single-nucleotide variant (SNV) detection rates with low allelic dropout (ADO) and low chimera formation as exemplified by sequencing HEK293 cells. Moreover, copy number variant (CNV) calling yields superior results compared with random primer-based MDA methods. The advantages of this method, which we named TruePrime, promise to facilitate and improve single-cell genomic analysis.},

	abstract = {When small RNA is sequenced on current sequencing machines, the resulting reads are usually longer than the RNA and therefore contain parts of the 3' adapter. That adapter must be found and removed error-tolerantly from each read before read mapping. Previous solutions are either hard to use or do not offer required features, in particular support for color space data. As an easy to use alternative, we developed the command-line tool cutadapt, which supports 454, Illumina and SOLiD (color space) data, offers two adapter trimming algorithms, and has other useful features. Cutadapt, including its MIT-licensed source code, is available for download at http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/},

	abstract = {Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads or long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date. Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a component of BWA, which is available at http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org},
