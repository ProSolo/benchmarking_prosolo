SCAN-SNV is not a single tool, but implemented as a Snakemake pipeline that is packaged as a conda tool.
This setup makes it impossible to easily set it up in a reproducible manner, let alone integrate it into another Snakemake pipeline.
We have done our best here, to include all infos that are necessary to reproduce what we have done, but for a proper reproduction, you will have to install SCAN-SNV via conda separately and make sure it is activated.
