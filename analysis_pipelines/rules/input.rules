"""
Set up local links to input files in the working directory.

Configuration should be provided in YAML format and specified in the Snakefile.
For a commented example, see config.yaml in the directory pipelines, especially:

folders:
    data: /path/to/where/your/data/is/to/be/found
runs:
    run1: pair
    run2: single
infix:
    single:
        - '.0'
    pair:
        - '.1'
        - '.2'

Data is expected to be organised in one folder per run, with the run name as folder
name and as file basename, with additional infixes, e.g. for the two files of run1
in the above example this would be:
/path/to/root/data/folder/run1/run1.1.fastq.gz
/path/to/root/data/folder/run1/run1.2.fastq.gz
